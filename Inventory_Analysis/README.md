# Project Title: Inventory and Sales Performance Analysis

## Summary
This project involves analyzing sales and inventory data across multiple stores to derive insights into product performance, store efficiency, and sales trends.

### Project Goals
1. **Production Performance Analysis**: Identify top-performing products based on total sales and profit.
2. **Store Performance Analysis**: Analyze sales performance for each store, including total revenue and profit margin.
3. **Complex Monthly Sales Trend Analysis**: Examine monthly sales trends, considering rolling averages and identifying months with significant growth or decline.
4. **Cumulative Distribution of Profit Margin**: Calculate the cumulative distribution of profit margins for each product category, focusing on profitable products.
5. **Store Inventory Turnover Analysis**: Analyze the efficiency of inventory turnover for each store by calculating the Inventory Turnover Ratio in percentage.

### Data Structure

- **Sales**: 
    - `Sale_ID` (int)
    - `REF_DATE` (date)
    - `Store_ID` (int)
    - `Product_ID` (int)
    - `units` (int)

- **Products**: 
    - `Product_ID` (tinyint)
    - `Product_Name` (nvarchar)
    - `Product_Category` (nvarchar)
    - `Product_Cost` (money)
