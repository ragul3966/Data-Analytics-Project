# Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

## Project Description

This project aims to analyze customer churn using a dashboard to understand key factors contributing to churn in a business. It focuses on customer behaviors, subscription plans, payment methods, and demographic information to derive actionable insights for improving customer retention.

## Domain

Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this churn analysis project were to:

1. Identify customers who left the service within the last month.

2. Analyze the services each customer subscribed to, including phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.

3. Examine customer account information such as tenure, contract type, payment method, paperless billing status, monthly charges, total charges, and the number of tickets opened in administrative and technical categories.

4. Investigate demographic information about customers, including gender, age range, and whether they have partners and dependents.

## Insights
1. Most customers opted for optic fiber services.

2. The churn rate is higher when customers are on a monthly subscription plan.

3. Customers who pay paperless bills using electronic checks (e-checks) experience a higher churn rate.

4. The churn rate is greater among single customers compared to those with dependents.

## Business Decisions

1. Promote annual or longer-term subscriptions to reduce churn.

2. Encourage alternative payment methods to e-checks for paperless billing customers.

3. Develop targeted retention strategies for single customers, potentially offering family or dependent incentives to increase loyalty.
